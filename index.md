# What?

This site aims to be a collection of ready-to-copy shell script snippets covering common build-related tasks
for the iOS and macOS projects.

# But why?

Xcode comes with a set of command-line utilities that can be used to automate app build and distribution.
[Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) is a great tool for build-related automations but sometimes you just need
one quick command or are curios about what happens under the hood.

Each time I need to do something like that I spend some time to search for a solution.
At some point I decided to start logging this in a structured for for further reference.
